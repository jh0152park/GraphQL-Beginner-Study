# API

## What is API?

API is `Application Programming` Interface, Also API is does not mean only to REST api or GraphQL api.

`Interface`: some way to connection or interacting with something(whatever anyting). (Interfaction + Face = InterfaceðŸ˜‚)

## Why we need it?

Becuase to communicate, sometime we want to communicate with BE or Server or anything else.

### REST API

When communicate with another servers or each others, or ios applications communicate with server, that communication built by url.

For example, if we have a server for has millions of movies database, and building ios application then I want to sort of entire movies from my database of server.

Its mean is I have to get data from server and show that data to user.

So, If I use REST API, probably make some request with url looks like `testmovies.co/api/movies', then this url will give me JSON data.

Also, so many sides can call this api, `browser, javascript, android application, ios application, etc...`

REST API is very easy to think to understand and also predictalbe!

How looks like REST API

```
testmovies.co/api/movies
testmovies.co/api/movies/1
testmovies.co/api/search?rating=9
```
